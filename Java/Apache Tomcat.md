#### **Server**:

- A **server** is hardware or software that listens to client requests (usually over the internet or a network) and responds with appropriate resources. There are many types of servers, but in the context of web development, a **web server** is the software responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving web pages or web content.
- Example: **Apache Tomcat** is a web server for Java applications, while **Apache HTTP Server** is a general-purpose web server for static content.

#### **Servlet**:

- A **servlet** is a small Java program that runs on a server and handles specific tasks related to web requests. Servlets are server-side components that respond to client requests, often generating dynamic content like HTML, JSON, etc., based on input from the user.
- **Servlets** are part of the **Java EE** framework and run within a web server or an application server (like Tomcat) that has a servlet container. A servlet container manages the lifecycle of servlets and routes HTTP requests to the appropriate servlets.
