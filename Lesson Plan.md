1. Introduction to ML
- What is it, where it's used, Supervised/Unsupervised/Real World Examples, Pipeline(Data collection -> Evaluation)

2. Data cleaning, preprocessing
- ML models are only as good as the data
- Handling missing data (Removing, Imputation)
- Outliers (Z-scores, IQR)
- Feature Scaling: Standardization (for bell shaped) vs Normalization (maintain proportions)
- Train test split, importance

3. Supervised Vs Unsupervised Learning
- Supervised: Train with label data, Classification, Regression
- Unsupervised: Unlabeled data: Clustering, Dimension reduct
- When to use each, real world examples

4. Supervised: Classification
- What is classification
- Common algorithms (logistic, knn, decision trees, svm's)
- Evaluation Metrics(accuracy, precision, recall, f1score)
